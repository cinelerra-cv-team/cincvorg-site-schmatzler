To use the git repo for working on this site:

1) add a new user to gitosis, by adding their public ssh key to the keydir and their name to the repo in gitosis.conf.
2) git clone git@git.cinelerra.org:www/cinelerra-site.git your-cin-site-copy

Make some changes, then 
git add newfile1.php newfile2.php
git commit -a -m "adding newfile 1 and 2"
git push

(There is a post-update hook which will automatically update the site when you push.)

To update your local copy with changes others have made:
git pull
(or possibly git pull git@git.cinelerra.org:www/cinelerra-site.git master)
