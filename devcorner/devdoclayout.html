<h1>The developer's documentation tree (draft)</h1>

<p>Cinelerra needs a knowledge base for the developers.  This is a
draft for the directory layout of that documentation.  Why bother
documenting the directory structure of something that has not been
made yet?  Because moving files around is a bitch in CVS!  And I
intend to maintain it through CVS.</p>

<h2>Proposed directory structure 1st draft, January 4th, 2004</h2>

...to be written...
