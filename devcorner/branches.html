<h1>Tags and branches (draft)</h1>

 <p>This is a history of how and why I create tags and
   branches in the Cinelerra CVS.
   <strong>It is outlining policies for tagging and branching
    that may be subject to change, hence "draft".</strong>
 </p>

<h2>Sun Oct 26, 2003: Debian Sid "BUILDS-OK_1"</h2>

<code>cvs tag r1_1_7-Debian-Sid-x86_BUILDS-OK_1</code>

<p>The CVS was tagged r1_1_7-Debian-Sid-x86_BUILDS-OK_1.  dpkg-buildpackage
 works out of the box from this CVS tag.<p>

<p>This is a symbolic revision name, not a branch.  It is added
 as a convenience to users and developers who want a snapshot
 that is known to build on Debian Sid.</p>


<h2>Sun Oct 26, 2003: Create the r1_1_7-test branch. (deprecated)</h2>

<code>cvs tag -b r1_1_7-TEST-patches1</code>

<p>A test branch was requested a week ago.  There were many
patches going around on the mailing list, and several probably
did not get tested.  Committing patches directly to HEAD was
considered too risky; HEAD had been broken for a few days after
some optimistic updates.</p>

<p>Instead of posting patches on the mailing list, committing
them to <em>version</em>_TEST-<em>patch-set</em> gives a more
convenient access to the patched sources.  Everybody with
web access can download a patched tarball from the
<a href="http://developer.skolelinux.no/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/external/cinelerra/hvirtual/">
viewcvs</a> CVS frontend.

<p><strong>Sat Nov 8, 2003:</strong>
The test branch is deprecated.  New stuff should go into HEAD.</p>
