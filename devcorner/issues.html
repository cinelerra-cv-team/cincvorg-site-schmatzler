<h1>Known issues and workarounds</h1>

<p>These are bugs we know about, and workarounds for some
 of them.  Workarounds are not fixes!  They just allow you
 to get by, until the bug is fixed.</p>

<h2>DV rendering is all green!</h2>

<p>Oct. 30, 2003: DV rendering is not SMP safe.  It will even
 fail on a single P4, producing an image that is pure green.<br>
 <strong>Workaround:</strong> In Preferences&rarr;Performance,
 check the "force single processor use" checkbox.
</p>

<h2>MP3 output is scrambled and full of echo</h2>

<p>Oct. 30, 2003: MP3 rendering is currently not SMP safe.
 It will even fail on a single P4.<br>
 <strong>Workaround:</strong> In Preferences&rarr;Performance,
 check the "force single processor use" checkbox.
</p>

<h2>In MPEG4 AVIs and MOVs the sound is badly out of synch</h2>

<p>No known workaround at this point</p>
