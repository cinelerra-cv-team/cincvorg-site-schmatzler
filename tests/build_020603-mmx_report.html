<h1>Source from CVS 02.Jun.2003. Built 08.Jun.2003, with mmx.</h1>

<h2>Building...</h2>

<p>
 Build system: Laptop with 500MHz AMD K6-2 CPU and 128MB RAM.<br>

 mmx or 3DNOW support enabled<br>

 Build time: ~45 minutes.
<p>

<h2>Running...</h2>

<p>Playback to ieee1394 has occational dropouts and jitter,
and the picture and sound disappears periodically.</p>

<p>Sustained DV playback framerate (X11-XV) is ~7 fps.
No significant improvement above the non-mmx build.
The viewer and the compositor are not much different.
</p>

<p>VCD-compatible MPEG1 playback got much smoother
(than without mmx) in the viewer; almost no frames
were dropped.  In the compositor, it was still a bit
jerky: Cinelerra reported 15fps.</p>
