<h1>Build from CVS 02/06, 2003</h1>

<h2>Building...</h2>

<p>
 Build system: Laptop with 500MHz AMD K6-2 CPU and 128MB RAM.<br>

 No mmx or 3DNOW support enabled (default)<br>

 Default <code>./configure</code>; no custom options.<br>

 Build time: 47 minutes.
<p>

<h2>Running...</h2>

<p>
 Switching video driver to and from ieee1394 does not
crash it anymore.  But exporting DV to a camcorder from
the timeline is glitchy, to put it mildly:
</p>

<p>Playback to ieee1394 has occational dropouts and jitter,
and the picture and sound disappears periodically.</p>

<p>Starting playback with ieee1394 as video device
 without the video1394 driver loaded crashes Cinelerra.
</p>

<p>Sustained DV playback framerate (X11-XV) is in the
5-7 fps range.  Sound is approx. 1/4 sec ahead of video.</p>
