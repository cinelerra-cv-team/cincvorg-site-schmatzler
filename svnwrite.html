<h1>Getting SVN write access</h1>


<div class="boxa">
<h2><a name="write">Getting ssh write access</h2>

    <p>If you have several changes to Cinelerra's source code you want to
      contribute, we prefer that you check them in yourself.  You need
      write access to the Subversion to do that.</p>
     <p>To get write access,
      send an email to <tt>herman@skolelinux.no</tt>, include your desired
      user name and password hash (which may be created by for instance 
      <a href="/scripts/cryptit">cryptit</a>).
    </p>
</div>

<div class="boxb">
<h2><a name="what">What do you get?</h2>

  <p>You get a shell account at <code>skolelinux.no</code>, also known as
  <code>cvs.cinelerra.org</code>.  The home directory shares a couple of
   gigabytes with the other Cinelerra SVN users.
   It'll be almost full most of the time, so be nice!</p>

   <p>You can put stuff on the Web by copying files to the public_html
   directory in your home directory.  The server supports PHP and Perl
   cgi.</p>
