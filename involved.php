  <h2>Our mailing lists</h2>

   <h4>Cinelerra CV</h4>

  <p>We have a mailing list dedicated to development and testing of new
   features, submitting patches, and resolving build problems. <br>
   We offer some handholding to newcomers with build problems and weird bugs, too.
   For real-time handholding, we recommend IRC.
  </p>

  <p>For attachments there is a size limit of 400KB. Messages with bigger attachments will be held waiting for moderator approval.</p>

  <p>
  <em> </em><br>

  There is a web interface for 
  <a href="http://lists.cinelerra-cv.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cinelerra">
  subscribing</a>, and a 
  <a href="http://lists.cinelerra-cv.org/pipermail/cinelerra/">
  Web archive</a> that anybody can browse.
  </p>

  <p>
  There is a 
  <a href="https://lists.skolelinux.org/pipermail/cinelerra/">
  web archive of the old mailing list</a> which is being phased out.
