<h1>Change format, and the mask outline and the mask don't line up</h1>

<p>Use the <a href="mask-demo.tgz">mask-demo.tgz</a> if you don't have
 any footage to play with.</p>


<h2>The bug</h2>

<p>If you create a mask, and change the output resolution, the mask
 outline and control points don't follow the actual mask anymore.</p>


<h2>How to reproduce</h2>

<p>Create a mask with a clear and obvious effect: E.g. a black square
on a bright background.  Or use the test project <a href="mask-demo.tgz">
mask-demo.tgz</a>, and use the gain slider in the patchbay to darken the
"lower" video track (Video 1).  You have to disable the "gang fader" to
fade down the video tracks individually.  Now you have very obvious mask
effect, as shown in <a href="mask-orig.png">this screenshot</a>.</p>

<p>Change the output format, e.g. to 1280x768 pixels.  Enjoy the
<a href="mask-mismatch.png">result</a>.  The mask outline has now very
little to do with the actual mask.</p>


<h2>Workaround?</h2>

<p>We'd like to here about a workaround, if it exists.</p>
