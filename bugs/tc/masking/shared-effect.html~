<h1>Quirks and bugs with masking</h1>

<p>Testcase(s) for masking bugs</p>


<h2>Testcase 1: Shared effect overrides mask (FIXED)</h2>

<p>
<strong>Status: FIXED</strong><br>
Andraz Tori submitted a one-line fix to the CVS.
</p>

<a href="shared-effect.html">Shared effect becomes
shared track instead</a> (UI bug)

<p>I stumbled on this when I was masking out a passer-by
in the background of a recording.  The masking went OK,
but then I wanted to colour-correct the video.

<h3>The bug</h3>

<p>Since I had two "layers" that were supposed to look
exactly the same, "sharing effects" seemed like a very
good idea.  I attached the <em>hue and saturation</em>
effect, to video track 1 (the one with the passer-by),
and ajusted it to my satisfaction.  Then I attached it
again as a "shared effect" on Video 2 (the masking track).
That made video1 vanish from the compositor.  As long
as I used the shared effect on Video 2, I had to disable
playback of Video 2 to see Video 1 at all.</p>


<h3>How to reproduce</h3>

<ol>
 <li> Download the <a href="maskbug.tgz">tarball</a> (5.2 MB)
with two short clips and the project files.</li>
 <li>Open the mask-demo.xml project file</li>
 <li>Attach the brightness/contrast effect to Video 1.</li>
 <li>Right-click on the Video 2 track, and pick "Attach effect..."</li>
 <li>In the Attach Effect dialog, select the entry "Video 1: Brightness/Contrast"
  (the only available one) from the "Shared effects" list, the one in the
  middle (See the
  <a href="http://developer.skolelinux.no/~herman/cinelerra/bugs/tc/masking/mask-attach.png">
  screenshot</a>).</li>
 <li>Click on the "Attach" button <em>below the Shared effects</em> list.</li>
</ol>

<p>What should happen: You get "Video 1: Brightness/Contrast" (shared effect)
attached to Video 2.</p>

<p>What did happen: I got "Video 1" (shared track) attached to Video 2.</p>


<h3>Workaround (thanks to Andraz Tori)</h3>

<p>Instead of first selecting, then clicking "Attach", just double-click
 the desired shared effect.  That works as expected.</p>


<h3>The project files, mask-demo.xml and mask-share_bug.xml</h3>

<p>If you open the <a href="mask-demo.xml">mask-demo.xml</a>
project file, you will se the masking effect as it was intended.
The colour correction has not been applied yet.  In
<a href="mask-share_bug.xml">mask-share_bug.xml</a>, the colour
correction is shared between video1 and video2, video2 being the
"master".</p>

<p>Try applying the colour correction effect yourself on the
mask-demo project.  Attaching effects on the video tracks
individually will work.  Sharing will trigger the bug.</p>

<p>The video files are MJPEG Quicktime rendered by Cinelerra at
a 50% quality setting, without sound.  This is four times smaller
than the original DV, which is of higher quality.</p>
