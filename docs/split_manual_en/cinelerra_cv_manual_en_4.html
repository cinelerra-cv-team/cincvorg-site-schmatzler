<p>When you play media files in Cinelerra, the media files have a certain number
of tracks, a certain frame size, a certain sample size, and so on and so forth.
No matter what attributes the media file has, it is played back according
to the project attributes.  So, if an audio file's sample rate is different than the
project attributes, it is resampled.  In like fashion, if a video file's frame 
size is different than the project attributes, the video is composited on a 
black frame, either cropped or bordered with black.
</p>
<p>The project attributes are adjusted in <b>Settings-&gt;Set Format</b> and to a
lesser extent in <b>File-&gt;New</b>.  When you adjust project settings in
<b>File-&gt;New</b>, a new, empty timeline is created.  Every timeline created
from this point on uses the same settings.  When you adjust settings in
<b>Settings-&gt;Format</b>, media on the timeline is left unchanged.  Also, every
timeline created from this point uses the same settings.
</p>

</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional settings for sample rate, frame rate, frame
size, Cinelerra uses some unusual settings like <b>channel positions, color
model, and aspect ratio.</b>

<p>Select an option from this menu to have all the project settings set to
one of the known standards.

<h2 class="section"> 4.3 Audio attributes </h2>

<ul>
<li> <b>Tracks</b><br>

<p>Sets the number of audio tracks for the new project.  Tracks can
be added or deleted later, but options are provided here for convenience.
</p>
</li><li> <b>Samplerate</b><br>
Sets the samplerate of the audio.  The project samplerate does not have to
be the same as the media sample rate that you load.  Media is resampled to
match the project sample rate.

</li><li> <b>Channels</b><br>
Sets the number of audio channels for the new project.  The number
of audio channels does not have to be the same as the number of tracks.

</li><li> <b>Channels positions</b><br>
The currently enabled audio channels and their positions in the audio panning
boxes in the track patchbay are displayed in the channel position widget.
</li></ul>

<p align="center"> <img src=".././manual_images_intl/channelpositions.png" alt="manual_images_intl/channelpositions">
</p><p align="center"> <b>The channel position widget</b>
</p>
<p>The channels are numbered.  When rendered, the output from channel 1 is
rendered to the first output track in the file or the first soundcard channel
of the soundcard.  Later channels are rendered to output tracks numbered
consecutively.
</p>
<p>The audio channel positions correspond to where in the panning widgets each of
the audio outputs is located.  The closer the panning position is to one of the audio
outputs, the more signal that speaker gets.  Click on a speaker icon and drag
to change the audio channel location.
</p>
<p>The speakers can be in any orientation.  A different speaker arrangement is
stored for every number of audio channels since normally you do not want the
same speaker arrangement for different numbers of channels.
</p>
<p>Channel positions is the only setting that does not affect the output
necessarily.
It is merely a convenience, so that when more than two channels are used, the
pan controls on the timeline can distinguish between them.  It has nothing to
do with the actual arrangement of speakers.
</p>
<p>Different channels can be positioned very close together to make them have
the same output.
</p>

<a name="SEC66"></a>
<h2 class="section"> 4.4 Video attributes </h2>

<ul>
<li> <b>Tracks</b><br>
Sets the number of video tracks the new project is assigned.  Tracks can
be added or deleted later, but options are provided here for convenience.

</li><li> <b>Framerate</b><br>
Sets the framerate of the video.  The project framerate does not have to be
the same as an individual media file frame rate that you load.  Media is reframed to match the
project framerate.

</li><li> <b>Canvas size</b><br>
Sets the size of the video output.  In addition, each track also has its own frame
size.  Initially, the <b>New Project</b> dialog creates video tracks whose size match
the video output.  The video track sizes can be changed later without
changing the video output.  See section <a href="cinelerra_cv_manual_en_6.html#SEC101">The track popup menu</a>.

</li><li> <b>Aspect ratio</b><br>
Sets the aspect ratio.  The aspect ratio is applied to the video output.
The aspect ratio can be different than the ratio that results from the formula:
h / v (the number of horizontal pixels divided into the number of vertical
pixels).  If the aspect ratio differs from the results of the formula above,
your output will be in non-square pixels.

</li><li> <b>Auto aspect ratio</b><br>
If this option is checked, the <b>New Project</b> dialog always recalculates the <b>Aspect
ratio</b> setting based upon the given <b>Canvas size</b>.  This ensures pixels are
always square.

</li><li> <b>Color model</b><br>
The project will be stored in the color model video intermediates selected in
the dropdown.<br>
Color model is very important for video playback because video has the
disadvantage of being very slow.  Although it is not noticeable, audio
intermediates contain much more information than the audio on disk and the
audio which is played.  Audio always uses the highest bandwidth intermediate
because it is fast.<br>
Video intermediates must use the least amount of data for the required quality
because it is slow, but video intermediates still use a higher bandwidth color
model than video which is stored and video which is played.  This allows more
processing to be done with less destruction of the original data.<br>
The video is stored on disk in one colormodel, usually a YUV
derivative.  When played back, Cinelerra decompresses it from the file format
directly into the format of the output device.  If effects are processed, Cinelerra
decompresses the video into an intermediate colormodel first and then converts it to
the format of the output device.  The selection
of an intermediate colormodel determines how fast and accurate the effects are.<br>
Cinelerra colormodels are described using a certain packing order of components
and a certain number of bits for each component.  The packing order is printed
on the left and the bit allocation is printed on the right.
<a name="IDX82"></a>
<ul>
<li> <b>RGB-888</b><br>
This allocates 8 bits for the R, G, and B channels and no alpha.  This is
normally used for uncompressed media with low dynamic range.
<a name="IDX83"></a>
</li><li> <b>RGBA-8888</b><br>
This allocates an alpha channel to the 8 bit RGB colormodel.  It is used
for overlaying multiple tracks.
<a name="IDX84"></a>
</li><li> <b>YUV-888</b><br>
This allocates 8 bits for Y, U, and V.  This is used for low dynamic range
operations in which the media is compressed in the YUV color space.  Most
compressed media is in YUV and this derivate allows video to be processed fast with the
least color degradation.
<a name="IDX85"></a>
</li><li> <b>YUVA-8888</b><br>
This allocates an alpha channel to the 8 bit YUV colormodel for transparency.
<a name="IDX86"></a>
</li><li> <b>RGB-Float</b><br>
This allocates a 32 bit float for the R, G, and B channels and no alpha.
This is used for high dynamic range processing with no transparency.
<a name="IDX87"></a>
</li><li> <b>RGBA-Float</b><br>
This adds a 32 bit float for alpha to RGB-Float.  This is used for high
dynamic range processing with transparency.
</li></ul>
<p><b>In order to do effects which involve alpha channels, a colormodel with an
alpha channel must be selected</b>.  These are RGBA8888, YUVA8888, and RGBA Float.
The 4 channel colormodels are slower than 3 channel colormodels,
with the slowest being RGBA Float.  Some effects, like fade, work around the
need for alpha channels while other effects, like chromakey, require an alpha
channel to do anything, so it is a good idea to try the effect without alpha
channels to see if it works before settling on an alpha channel and slowing it
down.<br>
When using compressed footage, YUV colormodels are usually faster than RGB colormodels.
They also destroy fewer colors than RGB colormodels.  If
footage stored as JPEG or MPEG is processed many times in RGB, the colors will
fade whereas they will not fade if processed in YUV.<br>
Years of working with high dynamic range footage have shown floating point RGB
to be the best format for high dynamic range.  16 bit integers were used
in the past and were too lossy and slow for the amount of improvement.<br>
RGB float does not destroy information when used with YUV source footage and
also supports brightness above 100%.  Be aware that some effects, like
Histogram, still clip above 100% when in floating point.
