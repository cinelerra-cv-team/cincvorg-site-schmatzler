<h1 class="chapter"> 15. Rendered effects </h1>
<p>Another type of effect is performed on a section of the track and the result
stored somewhere before it is played back.  The result is usually pasted into
the track to replace the original data.
</p>
<p>The rendered effects are not listed in the resource window but instead are
accessed through the <b>Audio-&gt;Render effect</b> and <b>Video-&gt;Render effect</b> menu
options.  Each of these menu options brings up a dialog for the rendered
effect.  Rendered effects apply to only one type of track, either audio or
video.  If no tracks of the type exist, an error pops up.
</p>
<p>A region of the timeline to apply the effect to must be defined before
selecting <b>Render effect...</b>.  If no in/out points and no highlighted region
exist, the entire region after the insertion point is treated as the affected
region.  Otherwise, the region between the in/out points or the highlighted
region is the affected region.
</p>
<p>Secondly, the tracks to apply the rendered affect to need to be <b>armed</b>.  All
other tracks are ignored.
</p>
<p>Finally, the rendered affect processes certain track attributes when it reads
its input data but not others.  Transitions in the affected track are applied.
Nudge is not and effects are not.  This allows the new data to be pasted into
the existing position without changing the nudge value.
</p>
<p>In the render effect dialog is a list of all the realtime and all the rendered
effects.  The difference here is that the realtime effects are rendered to disk
and not applied under the track.  Highlight an effect in the list to designate
it as the one being performed.
</p>
<p>Define a file to render the effect to in the <b>Select a file to render to</b>
box.  The <img src=".././manual_images_intl/magnify.png" alt="manual_images_intl/magnify"> magnifying glass allows file selection
from a list.
</p>
<p>Select a file format which can handle the track type.  The
<img src=".././manual_images_intl/wrench.png" alt="manual_images_intl/wrench"> wrench allows configuration specific to the
file format.
</p>
<p>There is also an option for creating a new file at each label.  If you have a
CD rip on the timeline which you want to divide into different files, the
labels would become dividing points between the files if this option were
selected.  When the timeline is divided by labels, the effect is re-initialized
at every label.  Normalize operations take the peak in the current file and not
in the entire timeline.
</p>
<p>Finally there is an insertion strategy just like in the render dialog.  It
should be noted that even though the effect applies only to audio or video, the
insertion strategy applies to all tracks just like a clipboard operation.
</p>
<p>When you click <b>OK</b> in the effect dialog, it calls the GUI of the effect.  If
the effect is also a realtime effect, a second GUI appears to prompt for
acceptance or rejection of the current settings.  After accepting the settings,
the effect is processed.

<p>This multiplies the number of each output sample by a scale factor to arrive at
the number of the input sample.  The output file's sample rate is set to the
project sample rate but its length is changed to reflect the scaled number of
samples.  It also filters the resampled audio to remove aliasing.
</p>
<p>If the scale factor is 2, every 2 input samples will be reduced to 1 output
sample and the output file will have half as many samples as the input
sequence.  If it is 0.5, every 0.5 input samples will be stretched to 1 output
sample and the output file will have twice as many samples as the input
sequence.

<p>This does exactly the same thing as <b>ReframeRT</b> in <b>Stretch</b> mode.  It
multiplies the output frame number by the scale factor to arrive at the input
frame number and changes the length of the sequence.  Unlike ReframeRT, this
must run from the <b>Video</b> menu and render its output.
</p>
<p>Be aware <b>Reframe</b> does not write the scaled frame rate as the frame rate of
the rendered file.  It produces a file of scaled length and equal frame rate as
the project.  The new length is 1/scale factor as big as the original sequence.
</p>
<p><b>To create a slow-motion of fast moving video:</b>
</p><ol>
<li> Select the video clip you wish to re-frame and put it on a
video track
</li><li> Select the area you wish to reframe
</li><li> From the Video menu, select the Render Effect option
</li><li> From the effect list, select Reframe
</li><li> Enter the output format and insertion strategy for the new
clip to be created
</li><li> Press ok
</li><li> At the popup menu, enter the scale factor 2 to run twice as
fast, and .5 to run at half speed

<h3 class="subsection"> 15.2.2 GreyCStoration </h3>

<p>GREYCstoration is an image regularization algorithm which is able to process a
color image by locally removing small variations of pixel intensities while preserving
significant global image features, such as edges and corners. The most direct
application of image regularization is image denoising.
</p>
<p>GREYCstoration is based on state-of-the-art image processing methods using
nonlinear multi-valued diffusion PDE (Partial Differential Equations). This kind of
method generally outperforms basic image filtering techniques (such as convolution,
median filtering, etc.), classically encountered in image painting programs.
</p>
<p>GREYCstoration is a rendered plugin, but it can be optionally used as a realtime effect.
It is important to note, however, that as a realtime effect, GreyCStoration is very slow.
</p>
<p><b>Parameters:</b>
</p><ol>
<li> <i>Amplitude (dt):</i> This parameter represents the average amount of smoothing
 that is performed. GREYCstoration performs a spatial averaging of pixel values, and
 Amplitude represents a kind of dimension of the area where the smoothing is computed.
 It is related to the PDE time step. Default value is 40. Prefer using a larger value than
  using multiple iterations when possible (at least until undesirable artifacts appear),
  it will speed up the whole process.
 </li><li> <i>Sharpness (p):</i> This parameter tells GREYCstoration about structure
  preservation. Once the local structures of the image have been detected,
  GREYCstoration has to decide how much he will smooth image pixels. Basically, it
  decreases the smoothing when the local structure is contrasted. The Sharpness
  parameter simply tells how this decreasing must be considered. When Sharpness is
  high, even low-contrasted structures will be preserved. Do not set Sharpness too high
  or the noise may be preserved. On the contrary, when Sharpness is low, the structures
  have to be very contrasted to avoid local smoothing. Do not set p too low or existing
  image structures will be over-smoothed. As you can see, there is a (sometimes difficult)
  trade-off to find when setting this parameter. Default value is 0.8 and typical values
  range from 0 to 5.
 </li><li> <i>Anisotropy (a):</i> This parameters set the anisotropy level of the considered
 smoothing. It ranges from 0 (which means 'purely isotropic') to 1 (which means 'purely
 anisotropic'). The anisotropy notion relates to the way the performed smoothing
 orientation will extend locally in space : a purely isotropic smoothing (0) will be performed
  in all possible directions, while a purely anisotropic smoothing (1) will be performed only
   along the directions of the structures. Values of anisotropy between 0 and 1 tell
   GREYCstoration to smooth the image mainly along the structure directions, but with a
   certain percentage of tolerance. Default value for a if 0.8 (which is already very anisotropic).
  </li><li> <i>Noise scale (alpha):</i> This parameter is mathematically defined as the standard
   deviation of a blurring gaussian kernel applied to the original image before estimating its
   geometry. In other words, it defines a kind of scale under which details won't be
   considered as structures but much more as noise. This parameter highly depends on the
   level of noise present on your image. Remember that increasing too much this parameter
   will tell GREYCstoration to smooth more structures. It can be useful for special visual effects
   though. Default value of alpha is 0.8, which is relatively low (many details should be
   preserved). Note how the details are ignored for high values of alpha.
</li></ol>
