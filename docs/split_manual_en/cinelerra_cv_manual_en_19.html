<h3 class="subsection"> 19.1.1 Cinelerra recording functions </h3>

<p>Ideally, all media would be stored on hard drives, CD-ROM, flash, or DVD and
loading it into Cinelerra would be a matter of loading a file.  In reality,
very few sources of media can be accessed like a filesystem but instead rely on
tape transport mechanisms and dumb I/O mechanisms to transfer the data to
computers.  These media types are imported into Cinelerra through the Record
dialog.
</p>
<p>The first step in recording is to configure the input device.  In
<b>Settings-&gt;preferences</b> are a number of recording parameters described in
configuration See section <a href="cinelerra_cv_manual_en_3.html#SEC53">Recording</a>.  These parameters apply to recording no matter
what the project settings are, because the recording parameters are usually the
maximum capability of the recording hardware while project settings come and
go.
</p>
<p>Go to <b>File-&gt;record</b> to record a dumb I/O source.  This prompts for an output
format much like rendering does.  Once that is done, the record window and the
record monitor pop up.
</p>
<p>The record window has discrete sections.  While many parameters change
depending on if the file has audio or video, the discrete sections are always
the same.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The output format area describes the format of the output file and the
current position within it.
</li><li> The edit batch area lets you change parameters in the current batch.
</li><li> The transport controls start and stop recording different ways.
</li><li> The batch list displays all the defined batches.
</li><li> The confirmation area lets you determine how the output files are
imported into the timeline and quit.
</li></ul>

</p>
<p>Recording in Cinelerra is organized around batches.  A batch essentially
defines a distinct output file for the recording.  For now you can ignore the
batch concept entirely and record merely by hitting the record button
<img src=".././manual_images_intl/record.png" alt="manual_images_intl/record">.
</p>
<p>The record button opens the current output file if it is not opened and writes
captured data to it.  Use the stop button to stop the recording.  Recording can
be resumed with the record button without erasing the file at this point.  In
the case of a video file, there is a single frame record button
<img src=".././manual_images_intl/singleframe.png" alt="manual_images_intl/singleframe"> which records a single frame.
</p>
<p>When enough media is recorded, choose an insertion method from the <b>Insertion
Strategy</b> menu and hit <b>close</b>.

<h3 class="subsection"> 19.1.2 Batch recording </h3>

<p>Now we come to the concept of batches.  Batches try to make the dumb I/O look
more like a filesystem.  Batches are traditionally used to divide tape into
different programs and save the different programs as different files instead
of recording straight through an entire tape.  Because of the high cost of
developing frame-accurate deck control mechanisms, the only use of batches now
is recording different programs during different times of day.  This is still
useful for recording TV shows or time lapse movies as anyone who can not afford
proper appliances knows.
</p>
<p>The record window supports a list of batches and two recording modes:
interactive and batch recording.  Interactive recording happens when the record
button is pressed.  Interactive recording starts immediately and uses the
current batch to determine everything except start time.  By default, the
current batch is configured to behave like tape.
</p>
<p>Batch recording happens when the <b>start</b> button is pressed.  In batch
recording, the <b>start time</b> is the time the batch starts recording.
</p>
<p>First, you will want to create some batches.  Each batch has certain parameters
and methods of adjustment.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>On</b><br>
Determines whether the batch is included in batch recording operations.  Click
the list row under <b>On</b> to enable or disable batches.

</li><li> <b>Path</b><br>
It is the file the batch is going to be recorded to.  The filename specified in
the record dialog is the name of the first batch, to simplify interactive
recording, but the filename may be changed in the record window for any batch
in the <b>edit batch</b> area.

</li><li> <b>News</b><br>
Shows whether the file exists or not.  This is a very important attribute since
there is no confirmation dialog if the file exists.  The first time you hit
record, the file is opened.  If the file exists at this point it is erased.
News says <b>File exists</b> if it exists and <b>OK</b> if it does not.  Every time
you resume recording in the same batch, the news should say <b>Open</b>,
indicating the file is already opened and will not be erased in the next record
button press.<br>
If you change out of the current batch after recording, the file is closed.
Next time you change into the batch, the file will be erased.

</li><li> <b>Start time</b><br>
It is the 24 hour time of day the batch will start recording if in batch mode.
The start time may become a time of tape and reel number if deck control is
implemented but for now it is a time of day.

</li><li> <b>Duration</b><br>
This is the length of the batch.  It only has meaning if the <b>Mode</b> of the
batch is <b>Timed</b>.  Once the recording length reaches <b>duration</b> the
recording stops, whether in interactive or batch mode.

</li><li> <b>Source</b><br>
This has meaning only when the capturing hardware has multiple sources.
Usually the source is a tuner channel or input.  When the current batch
finishes and the next batch begins recording, the source is changed to what the
next batch is set to.  This way multiple TV stations can be recorded at
different times.
</li></ul>

<p>The record window has a notion of the <b>current batch</b>.  The current batch is
not the same as the batch which is highlighted in the batch list.  The current
batch text is colored red in the batch list.  The highlighted batch is merely
displayed in the edit batch section for editing.
</p>
<p>By coloring the current batch red, any batch can be edited by highlighting it,
without changing the batch to be recorded.
</p>
<p>All recording operations take place in the current batch.  If there are
multiple batches, highlight the desired batch and hit <b>activate</b> to make it
the current batch.  If the <b>start</b> button is pressed, the current batch
flashes to indicate it is waiting for the start time in batch mode.  If the
<b>record</b> button is pressed, the current batch is recorded immediately in
interactive mode.
</p>
<p>In batch and interactive recording modes, when the current batch finishes
recording the next batch is activated and performed.  All future recording is
done in batch mode.  When the first batch finishes, the next batch flashes
until its start time is reached.
</p>
<p>Interrupt either the batch or the interactive operation by hitting the stop
button.
</p>
<p>Finally there is the <img src=".././manual_images_intl/rewind.png" alt="manual_images_intl/rewind"> rewind button.  In either
interactive or batch recording, the rewind button causes the current batch to
close its file.  The next recording operation in the current batch deletes the
file.

<a name="SEC267"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> 19.1.3 Editing tuner information </h3>

<p>Sometimes in the recording process and the configuration process, you will need
to define and select tuner channels to either record or play back to.  In the
case of the Video4Linux and Buz recording drivers, tuner channels define the
source.  When the Buz driver is also used for playback, tuner channels define
the destination.
</p>
<p>Defining tuner channels is accomplished by pushing the <img src=".././manual_images_intl/channel.png" alt="manual_images_intl/channel">
channel button.  This brings up the channel editing window.  In this window you
add, edit, and sort channels.  Also, for certain video drivers, you can adjust
the picture quality.
</p>
<p>The <b>add</b> operation brings up a channel editing box.  The title of the
channel appears in the channel list.  The source of the channel is the entry in
the physical tuner's frequency table corresponding to the title.
</p>
<p>Fine tuning in the channel edit dialog adjusts the physical frequency slightly
if the driver supports it.  The norm and frequency table together define which
frequency table is selected for defining sources.  If the device supports
multiple inputs, the input menu selects these.
</p>
<p>To sort channels, highlight the channel in the list and push <b>move up</b> or
<b>move down</b> to move it.
</p>
<p>Once channels are defined, the <b>source</b> item in the record window can be used
to select channels for recording.  The same channel selecting ability also
exists in the record monitor window.  Be aware channel selections in the record
monitor window and the record window are stored in the current batch.
</p>
<p>For some drivers an option to <b>swap fields</b> may be visible.  These drivers
do not get the field order right every time without human intervention.  Toggle
this to get the odd and even lines to record in the right order.

<h2 class="section"> 19.2 Capturing using dvgrab </h2>

<p>dvgrab is great and simple to use a command line tool to capture videos from a
DV camcorder.  When invoked it will automatically put your camera in play
mode, and start storing the videos on your hard disk.  Video files will be
labeled sequentially, as: <tt>`001.avi'</tt>, <tt>`002.avi'</tt> and so on.
</p>
<p>To install dvgrab, use your distribution preferred installation mechanism (apt,
rpm, deb, etc) or refer to the dvgrab webpage.
</p>
<p>Capturing videos in four easy steps:
</p><ol>
<li> Create a directory where you want the capture videos to be stored
</li><li> <code>cd</code> to that directory
</li><li> Type: <code>dvgrab --buffers 500</code> and <kbd>RETURN</kbd>
</li><li> Press <kbd>CTRL-C</kbd> to stop capturing video
</li></ol>

<p>The <samp>`--autosplit'</samp> option is very useful.  It splits scenes according to
the timecode.  However, that only works when grabbing from a DV camcorder.  It
will not work when grabbing from a analog/digital converter such as a Canopus
ADVC110.
</p>
<p>Read the dvgrab manual to get more information about dvgrab features.
