 <h1>Cinelerra GIT - accessing the GIT</h1>

  The source code of Cinelerra-CV, although having the primary branch
in a available in a Subversion repository is also available in a git
repository, (distributed SCM).

It happens sometimes that people send new patches/bufixes to this ML
which eventually might get forgotten. To offer a chance that such things
are picked easily up somewhere. I created a 'mob' repository on my
server where anyone can push patches anonymously.

Little HowTo:
# first clone the repository
# (use the --reference option when you already have any other
# git clone of a cinelerra repo)
git clone git://git.pipapo.org/cinelerra/mob my_cinelerra
cd my_cinelerra

# then create a branch for your work
git checkout -b yourbranchname

# work and commit
..hack..hack..hack
git commit ...

# send it to my server, maybe with some branch description,
# see the git-push manpage
git push --all


IMPORTANT:
Do not trust the code in this repository, anyone could add potentially
dangerous code, review every foreign commit before run anything
(autogen.sh, ./configure).

I'd suggest to use gpg signed tags when you reviewd some state and trust
it (man gpg-tag). Such tags then sign the state and all its history.

Further I don't make any rules how this might be used, feel free to
acknowledge with other people to make this repository useful. The only
thing I will do is regulary or automatically rebasing the master branch
on the ongoing SVN synced repository, I'll tag the tree before doing so,
but any conflicts occuring during this rebase will be thrown out of the
master branch (they are still reachable from the tag) but contributors
would need to resolve conflicts and reapply them on the master branch
again if they didn't worked in topic branches.

If you have any questions about this, feel free to contact me via mail
or on IRC.
