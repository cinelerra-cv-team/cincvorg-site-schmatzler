<h1>A spec?  Do we have such a thing?!</h1>

<p>Not yet, really.  But I sure hope some sort of
 functional specifications will come to be, eventually.

<h2>Expected/unexpected behaviours, annoyances</h2>

<p>A <a href="behaviour.html">document</a> listing some
 of Cinelerra's expected/unexpected, convenient/annoying
 behaviours is in the making.</p>

<p>File format and codec support is also a candidate
 for the specs.</p>

<p>Coding standards; do we want them or need them?</p>

<p>This is still a rough outline...</p>
